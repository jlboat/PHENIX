# PHENIX
A multiple phenotype imputation method for genetic studies

PHENIX (PHENotype Imputation eXpediated) is the name of our method for imputing missing phenotypes where samples have an arbitrary level of relatedness. The method can also be used for dimensionality reduction of multiple traits in related samples. The resulting latent traits can be tested as phenotypes, and can result in an increase in power.

We have made available an R package that implements this method for non-commercial use only. See licence for details.

We are developing methods for Bayesian Sparse multi-trait GWAS in related and unrelated samples.
